    <h1>Protecting Our Planet: Pooja Design A Call for Environmental Action</h1>
    <p class="meta">By Jane Doe | May 25, 2025</p>

    <p class="intro">

      <span class="more-text">
        Every small action matters. Choosing to recycle, reducing waste, conserving water, and switching to renewable energy sources are steps anyone can take. Governments and industries must also take responsibility by creating sustainable policies and investing in green technology.
        <br /><br />
        The time to act is now. The health of our planet directly impacts our future generations.
