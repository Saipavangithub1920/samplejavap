    <div class="title">What is the Environment?</div>
    <div id="envContent" class="content">
      The environment refers to everything that surrounds us: the air we breathe, the water we drink, the soil we grow food in, and the ecosystems we live in. It includes both natural and human-made elements. <br><br>
      A healthy environment is essential for all living beings. Forests provide oxygen, regulate temperature, and support biodiversity. Oceans regulate climate and are home to millions of species. Rivers give us freshwater, and soil helps grow our food.<br><br>
      However, human activities have started to disrupt nature‚Äôs balance. Deforestation, pollution, overuse of plastic, industrialization, and carbon emissions are leading to climate change, loss of species, and health issues.<br><br>
      Global warming is one of the most serious challenges today. It results in rising temperatures, melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and extreme weather like floods and droughts.<br><br>
      Air pollution from vehicles and factories is causing respiratory diseases. Water pollution harms aquatic life and affects drinking water sources. Soil pollution impacts food quality.<br><br>
      Deforestation leads to loss of habitat for animals and reduces oxygen levels. Urbanization and mining destroy landscapes and cause imbalance in local climates.<br><br>
      Sustainability is the solution. It means using resources wisely so future generations can live well too. This includes switching to renewable energy like solar and wind, planting trees, conserving water, and recycling waste.<br><br>
      Governments, organizations, and individuals all play a role. Global agreements like the Paris Climate Accord aim to reduce greenhouse gases. NGOs plant trees and clean rivers. Citizens are adopting eco-friendly habits like cycling, reducing plastic, and conserving energy.<br><br>
      Young people are becoming environmental advocates. Schools are teaching about climate change and organizing clean-up drives. Technology is also helping‚Äîgreen buildings, electric cars, and sustainable farming are great examples.<br><br>
      Every small step matters. Turn off lights when not needed. Avoid plastic bags. Walk or cycle for short distances. Plant a tree. These may seem minor, but collectively they have a big impact.<br><br>
      The environment is not someone else's responsibility. It‚Äôs ours. Let‚Äôs protect nature, not just for animals or plants, but for our health, future, and peace of mind. <br><br>
      As Greta Thunberg said, ‚ÄúYou are never too small to make a difference.‚Äù<br><br>
      Together, we can restore our planet. Let‚Äôs make Earth a better place to live for all.
